# Boxaverse

[BOXAVERSE] is a game about helping the strange little people living in a cardboard box that has appeared in your backyard. You can give them orders to help fulfill their goals, using your magnifier to gain a new perspective of the small world.

It was developed for Ludum Dare 38, so keep in mind that the code is pretty awful (but functional!)
